## Here's the text with a bit more flavor:

"I've got a stack of books I'm committed to diving into:

- Efficient Linux at the Command Line' by Daniel J. Barret
- The Rust Programming Language' by Steve Klabnik & Carol Nichols
- David Rockefeller Memoirs' by an Author I can't wait to discover
- Mañana en la Batalla Piensa en Mí' by the talented Javier Marias
- Seeing like a State' by the insightful James C. Scott

It's quite a diverse collection, carefully curated to enrich my knowledge and enhance my reading experience. If I come across any exciting new titles, you can bet I'll update this post with them."
