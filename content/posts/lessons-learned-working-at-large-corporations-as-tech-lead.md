### The Good

One thing I liked about working at large companies is that what you do really has a big impact—
whether good or bad, it affects real users. You have to make sure you deliver the best product
you can. It's your time to shine and show how you can help customers have less friction when
using the company's goods and services.

Sure, this comes with other great things like meeting new people, building teams, and getting to know smart people—all paddling in the same direction.

There are also perks like insurance benefits and small food bonuses on top of your salary.

I must also say that you often get to work at financial sector buildings with the company logo at the top. Yes! You feel kinda proud having reached that level. It gives you some kind of social currency status at the same time.

You start going to meetings where you can catch a glimpse of the CEO or CTO and think, "One day I'll be there"—what a lie!...

### The Bad

Not all, but most big companies—precisely because they're so big—usually don't have a clear internal path or process. It's like the wild west at times, but you get used to pushing ahead.

No one is there to help you. It's like everyone is in a 10K race every single day, trying to meet impossible deadlines to reach that milestone.

You start understanding that going out for lunch isn't so smart after all. Then you understand why people stay and eat at their desks at work.

At the same time, when you get home, you feel like your soul has been drained from all those impossible tasks that need to be done before yesterday.

You start learning about something called "office politics," and you learn it the hard way. Because you're there alone. Like getting blamed for something over email when the person nicely agreed via chat but stabs you in the back over email. Or people who want to move up the ladder and try to do it by stepping on your shoulders with knives in your back. You end up not trusting anyone. 


### The Ugly

I don't know about other people's experiences, but mine was complete hell. Many times I ended up seeing the sunrise, working because I needed to finish something where the deadline wasn't well planned—and the people below suffer the consequences.

Feeling sick and still needing to go to work, or even vomiting, and your boss saying it's normal and please go back to work. Going to the dentist and getting asked to hurry up so you can get back to work. And the cherry on top of the banana split: getting contacted by HR and asked why you didn't go to the End of Year company celebration. And answering that you were working long shifts and weekends. And their answer is just "Ok. Thanks."

### Conclusion

- Always remember not to trust anyone—they are work colleagues, no more than that.
- Set boundaries. If they're asking you to work late or weekends for the company's benefit and there's no compensation for it, don't do it.
- Your boss only uses you like a tool. There is no such thing as "family."
- Document evidence of bad behavior. Usually companies delete chats and emails monthly or every two weeks. Use your phone to save evidence of bad practices.
- Do the best you can without burning yourself out.
- Sometimes companies are great, but sometimes people are the problem.
- Don't worry about being fired—you don't control that. Worry about what you can control.
- Big companies are great to learn and learn fast, then move out. It's a real meat grinder that will drain your soul and energy.
- Choose health over money. It's not worth the money when you get sick and have to spend it all getting your health back.
- Don't outshine your boss.
- Make your boss look smart with your knowledge—you'll become important.
- Always, always! leave and confirm important information over email, never over chat, talk etc. people will use this against you, if you do not have proof of it.
