      <description>Rust is a great language, so since we&amp;rsquo;ve heard so far that is one great programming language to build embedded systems, why not create a program that writes messages on a LCD Screen. In this case we will be using a I2C LCD Screen. A ESP32-C3 and Rust Language using Standard Library and Espressif Framework.
The good In comparison to Arduino is way better since you don&amp;rsquo;t depend on limitations of wrappers.</description>

      <description>OnBoarding Like any other company there is a onboarding path you must follow. this can be; configuring your VPN, Credential setup, etc..
After this. you dont really start coding, about a week later; after you meet your peers. at first is really interesting. and the reason of this is due to the fact that you only know the tip of the iceberg.
after this you start getting basic tasks, and doing some shadow work with other collegue or supervisor.</description>
