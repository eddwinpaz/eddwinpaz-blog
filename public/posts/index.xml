      <description>OnBoarding Like any other company there is a onboarding path you must follow. this can be; configuring your VPN, Credential setup, etc..
After this. you dont really start coding, about a week later; after you meet your peers. at first is really interesting. and the reason of this is due to the fact that you only know the tip of the iceberg.
after this you start getting basic tasks, and doing some shadow work with other collegue or supervisor.</description>
